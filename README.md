# animations

This repository contains various examples of animated visualizations created using Python. These animations showcase different concepts, effects, and techniques.

## Installation

To run the animations locally, you'll need to have Python and the required dependencies installed. A crucial depedency is the `fastEMRIWaveforms` package located at https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms . This repository should be cloned and an environment set up so that you can generate EMRI trajectories locally.

Once FEW is installed locally, you can progress with making your own animations. 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/OllieBurke/animations.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd animations

## Usage

1. In the directory `animations/geodesic_equations_kerr`, one can build a snapshot of a Kerr trajectory. To build a snapshot, execute `python kerr_traj.py` 
2. In the directory `animations/animation_code`, one can construct an animation showing a small compact object orbiting into a massive black hole. It can be executed running the command `python animation_kerr.py`.

Enjoy. 

Feel free to explore the examples and modify the scripts to experiment with different parameters or effects.
